/// Ranks the AgriReels feed.
///
/// **The objective is not watch time.** Instagram ranks for time-on-app because
/// it sells ads; KrishiDukaan earns when a farmer finds a product and orders it.
/// So the scorer weights geography and commercial intent far above raw
/// engagement — a viral reel from a shop 400km away that cannot deliver to the
/// viewer is worth less than a modest reel from the shop in their taluka.
///
/// The actual signals live under `signals/`, one file per idea, each
/// implementing [RankingSignal]. This file only composes them: it does not
/// know what "geo" or "freshness" mean, just that [rankingSignals] lists
/// scorers and [RankingWeights] says how much each one counts. See
/// `signals/ranking_signal.dart` for why that split exists.
///
/// Ranking runs **client-side** over a candidate pool. At current scale this is
/// deliberate: no Cloud Function invocations, no extra infra bill, and no
/// composite Firestore indexes (this repo has been bitten by undeployed indexes
/// before — see ReelsRepository.fetchSellerReels). Move it server-side only when
/// the candidate pool outgrows a single query. See
/// docs/reels-ranking-architecture.md §2 for the full staging plan.
