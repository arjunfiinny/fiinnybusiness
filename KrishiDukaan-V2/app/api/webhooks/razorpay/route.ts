/**
 * Razorpay webhook — the server-to-server signal that closes the gaps our
 * own client-side reporting can never close. Two events, two gaps:
 *
 * payment.failed — Razorpay's dashboard was showing failed payments that
 * never appeared in Admin -> Payments, because that page only learned about
 * a failure if OUR app detected it and phoned home. A killed app, a dropped
 * connection, or an old app build all mean the failure is real on Razorpay's
 * side and invisible on ours.
 *
 * payment.captured — the mirror image, and the more expensive one: a payment
 * Razorpay captured (and whose seller Route transfer it already executed)
 * where the app never reached the step that writes our `orders` document.
 * The customer paid; on our side there was no order, no seller notification,
 * nothing — a real ₹1,311 order on 16 Sep 2026 went exactly this way. When
 * this event arrives and no order exists after a short grace period (so the
 * normal client path gets to finish first), the order is rebuilt server-side
 * from the paymentAttempts record. See app/lib/order-recovery.ts.
 *
 * transfer.processed / transfer.failed / settlement.processed — a seller's
 * Route transfer moved; the order is re-checked with Razorpay right away
 * (app/lib/payout-sync.ts) instead of at its next scheduled check.
 *
 * Configure in Razorpay Dashboard -> Settings -> Webhooks:
 *   URL:    https://krishidukan.com/api/webhooks/razorpay
 *   Events: payment.failed, payment.captured, transfer.processed,
 *           transfer.failed, settlement.processed
 *   Secret: put the same value in RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
 * (This is a DIFFERENT secret from RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET — the webhook secret
 * is generated when the webhook is created in the Dashboard.)
 */

/**
 * How long to let the normal client path finish before rebuilding an order
 * ourselves. Razorpay fires payment.captured within seconds of capture, often
 * before the app has even received its own success callback — jumping in
 * immediately would race the client and produce two orders for one payment.
