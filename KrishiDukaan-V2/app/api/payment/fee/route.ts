/**
 * POST /api/payment/fee — the real payment-gateway charge on one order.
 *
 * The seller's payout is `order total − KrishiDukan platform fee − gateway fee`.
 * The platform fee used to be reported as a hardcoded 0 here, which was the API
 * end of the site-wide "0% commission" claim; it is now derived from
 * settings/route, the same document app/lib/route-split.ts splits the payment
 * with, so the figure shown to the seller is the figure actually deducted.
 *
 * "Actually deducted" is meant literally: a fee is reported only for an order
 * Razorpay really split. Seller onboarding onto Route is lazy, so most orders
 * still settle whole to the platform with nothing taken from the seller, and
 * quoting the configured rate on those would show a deduction that never
 * happened.
 *
 * Showing the gateway charge honestly needs Razorpay's ACTUAL fee, which is not
 * in the payment-success payload the client sees — it only appears on the
 * payment entity after capture. So it is fetched here with the key secret and
 * cached onto the order doc, which also gives reconciliation a stored number
 * rather than a recomputed guess.
 *
 * Authorisation: the caller must be the seller on that order (or an admin).
 * Fee data is business-sensitive and this route runs with the key secret, so
 * it verifies a Firebase ID token rather than trusting anything in the body.
