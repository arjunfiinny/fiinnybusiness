/**
 * POST /api/payment/order-status
 *
 * Reconciles a Razorpay order against Razorpay's own records, independent of
 * whatever the checkout SDK told the client.
 *
 * Why this exists: the native (Android/iOS) razorpay_flutter checkout has its
 * own internal wait for the payment to complete and fires PAYMENT_ERROR with
 * "you could not complete it in time" once that wait elapses — this is the
 * SDK giving up on WATCHING the payment, not Razorpay's own record of whether
 * it succeeded. A UPI collect request approved a little late (slow network,
 * switching apps, bank delay) lands after the SDK stops waiting, so the money
 * is captured on Razorpay's side while the app is already showing "Failed".
 * That is exactly what was reported: "we do get the payment but the app says
 * failed".
 *
 * So instead of trusting the SDK's local timeout as gospel, the client asks
 * THIS endpoint — which asks Razorpay directly — before it commits to telling
 * the customer their payment failed. Trust boundary: this reads Razorpay's
 * server records with our own secret key, so unlike the client-supplied
 * signature in /api/payment/verify, nothing here can be forged by the caller;
 * the only check needed is that the caller isn't probing a stranger's order.
