/**
 * Legal identity, routes and versioning — the client-safe half of app/lib/legal.ts.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SPLIT OUT
 * -------------------
 * legal.ts reads settings/route through firebase/firestore/lite so the fee rates
 * quoted on a legal page cannot drift from the rates the payment split applies.
 * That is right for a server component, and wrong for the footer and the
 * subscription checkout, which are client components that need nothing but the
 * three URLs and the version string. Importing legal.ts there would pull the
 * Firestore lite SDK into the client bundle to read four constants.
 *
 * So: pure constants here, Firestore-backed rate lookups in legal.ts (which
 * re-exports everything below, so a server component can keep importing one
 * module).
 *
 * NOTHING IN COMPANY IS INVENTED. Every field is copied from what the site
 * already publishes, with the reference noted. A fact that is missing stays
 * missing rather than becoming plausible fiction in a document a court could
 * read — see the note on the deliberate omissions.
