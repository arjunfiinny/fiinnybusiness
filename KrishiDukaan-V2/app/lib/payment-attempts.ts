/**
 * Payment attempt tracking.
 *
 * Every Razorpay order this app creates gets a `paymentAttempts/{razorpayOrderId}`
 * document written server-side at creation time, before the customer ever sees
 * the checkout sheet. The status is then moved to 'paid' or 'failed' as the
 * payment resolves.
 *
 * Why server-side, when the clients already logged failures to `failedPayments`:
 *
 *  1. The client cannot be relied on to report. A killed app, a closed browser
 *     tab, a dropped connection mid-UPI — all produce a real lost sale that the
 *     old client-side logging never recorded at all.
 *  2. An abandoned checkout (customer dismisses the Razorpay sheet) was never
 *     recorded by anything. Those attempts simply stay 'created' here, which is
 *     how the admin view surfaces them.
 *  3. Only the server knows what was in the basket. `create-cart-order` already
 *     resolves every item's real price from Firestore to build the charge; that
 *     same resolved list is stored here, so admin can see WHICH products and at
 *     what price a failed payment was for. The old failedPayments record had
 *     only an amount and a Razorpay order id.
 *
 * Written exclusively through the Admin SDK, which bypasses Firestore rules —
 * the matching rule denies all client writes so a customer cannot forge or
 * tamper with the record of what they tried to buy.
