/**
 * Self-serve subscription pricing — the single source of truth.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The per-listing price used to be hardcoded in four places that nothing kept
 * in sync:
 *
 *   api/payment/create-order/route.ts  PRICE_PER_SEAT   ← what the seller is CHARGED
 *   views/SubscriptionView.tsx         DURATION_OPTIONS ← what the seller SEES
 *   app/sell/page.tsx                  PLANS            ← the public marketing page
 *   plans/ collection (admin UI)       ← admin-assigned subscriptions only
 *
 * Editing the price in the admin Plans tab changed none of the first three, and
 * missing one of them meant either charging more than was displayed (a billing
 * complaint) or less (lost revenue). All three now read `settings/pricing`
 * through this module.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as the `plans` collection. A `plans` doc is an
 * admin-assigned bundle (a price for N seats). This is the public self-serve
 * ladder: a price PER listing for each duration. Different shape, different
 * consumer — kept separate so changing one cannot silently alter the other.
 *
 * FALLBACK IS DELIBERATE. Every reader falls back to DEFAULT_DURATIONS when the
 * document is missing or malformed. A payment must never fail because a
 * settings doc was deleted, and the defaults below are the prices that were
 * hardcoded before this module existed — so a total read failure behaves
 * exactly like the old code did.

   * Rs 144/listing year and a Rs 4,999-for-50-listings year are different
