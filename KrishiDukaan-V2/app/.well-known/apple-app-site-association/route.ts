// iOS silently opens every link in Safari. The App Store app is

// and PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER in mobile/ios/Runner.xcodeproj). It was changed
// on 28 Sep to "…krishidukaanApp" — an id registered in Firebase but never
// shipped — which is why shared links stopped opening the app on iPhone.
// Do not change it without checking the App Store listing first.
