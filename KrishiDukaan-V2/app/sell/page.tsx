/**
 * Public, indexable seller-acquisition page.
 *
 * Every other seller surface (/dashboard/upgrade, /dashboard/subscription) is
 * auth-gated AND Disallow'd in robots.ts, so nothing on the site answered the
 * seller-intent query "where can I sell agri products online and what does it
 * cost". This page is the crawlable answer, and it states the real numbers in
 * plain text so search engines and AI answer engines can quote them.
 *
 * EVERY number on this page is derived, never typed:
 *
 *   subscription prices  ← settings/pricing (app/lib/pricing.ts), the same
 *                          document api/payment/create-order charges from
 *   platform fee         ← settings/route   (app/lib/legal.ts wrapping
 *   gateway fee            app/lib/route-split.ts), the same document
 *                          api/payment/create-cart-order splits a payment with
 *
 * so the advertised figure cannot drift from the billed one.
 *
 * THIS PAGE USED TO SAY "0% commission, always" and "you keep 100% of your
 * price", in the H1, the hero stat, a feature card, two FAQ answers and the
 * JSON-LD offer schema. That was hand-typed in ten places with nothing tying it
 * to the code, and it stopped being true the moment a platform fee existed. The
 * legal statement of these charges is app/seller-terms/page.tsx; this page is
 * the plain-language summary of it and must not contradict it.

KrishiDukan provides the technology platform, the discovery surface and the payment flow.",

    q: "Who can sell on KrishiDukan?",

You must hold the licences required for what you sell — a CIB & RC registration for pesticides and insecticides, and a fertilizer licence for fertilizers, as required under Indian law. Seeds, tools, sprayers and equipment have their own applicable requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a licence to sell pesticides or fertilizers online?",

  },
  {
    q: "How do I get paid?",
    a: "Online payments settle to the account you register with us, through the payment service provider, net of the KrishiDukan platform fee, the gateway charges and applicable taxes. Cash-on-delivery orders are collected by you directly. Your payouts and the charges on each order are visible in the payouts section of your seller dashboard. Settlement timing depends on the payment service provider and your account setup.",

  {
    q: "Can I try it with just one product?",

            transactions — so your cost barely moves as your sales grow.
