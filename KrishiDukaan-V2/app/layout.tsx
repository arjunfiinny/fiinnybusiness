   * Root canonical, INHERITED by every page that does not set its own.
   *
   * It is load-bearing rather than boilerplate: the homepage is a client
   * component that cannot export metadata of its own, and the SPA is reachable
   * at /?view=market, /?view=hub and friends. This tag is what collapses all of
   * those query-string variants onto "/" instead of letting each one be crawled
   * as a separate page. Removing it would be actively harmful.
   *
   * The cost is that a new public page which forgets `alternates` silently
   * claims the homepage as its canonical and can never be indexed — which is
   * exactly what happened to /blog and /privacy. EVERY new public, indexable
   * route must set its own alternates.canonical.
