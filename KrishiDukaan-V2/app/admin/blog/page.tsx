    excerpt: "Millions of Indian farmers still travel hours to buy seeds and fertilizers. KrishiDukan is changing that — connecting farmers with verified local retailers, real-time stock, and online delivery, all in one app.",
    content: `<h2>The Problem Every Indian Farmer Knows</h2><p>Picture this: a farmer in rural Maharashtra wakes up at 4 AM, rides his two-wheeler 40 km to the nearest agri-input shop, only to find that the fertilizer he needs is out of stock. He returns empty-handed, losing a day of work and money on fuel. This happens to <strong>millions of Indian farmers every season</strong>.</p><p>India has 146 million farming households. Yet most of them still rely on word-of-mouth to find where to buy seeds, fertilizers, or pesticides. There's no reliable way to know which shop has what in stock, at what price, and how far it is.</p><h2>What KrishiDukan Does Differently</h2><p>KrishiDukan is built around one idea: <strong>every farmer deserves access to verified agri-inputs, at fair prices, from a trusted local source — without wasting a day traveling.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hyperlocal store listing</strong> — See agri-retail shops sorted by distance from your location. Know exactly who is 2 km away vs 20 km away before you leave home.</li><li><strong>Verified retailers and manufacturers</strong> — Every seller on the platform goes through a registration and verification process. No anonymous vendors, no fake products.</li><li><strong>Real product listings with stock data</strong> — Each product shows which nearby stores carry it, at what price, and whether it's in stock today.</li><li><strong>Online ordering from local stores</strong> — When a retailer enables online delivery, farmers can place orders directly from the app and get delivery to their doorstep.</li><li><strong>Multi-language support</strong> — KrishiDukan works in English, Marathi, and Hindi — because farmers shouldn't need to speak English to use technology.</li></ul><h2>For Retailers and Manufacturers</h2><p>KrishiDukan isn't just for buyers. For agri-retailers and manufacturers, it's a digital storefront without the cost of building one.</p><ul><li>Create a free business profile and get discovered by farmers within 10–50 km</li><li>List your products and update stock levels from your phone</li><li>Accept online orders and manage delivery from your dashboard</li><li>Connect directly with manufacturers to expand your product range</li></ul><blockquote>We built KrishiDukan because we believe Indian agriculture deserves the same technology that transformed urban retail. The farmer who grows our food shouldn't be the last one to benefit from the digital economy.</blockquote><h2>Who Should Use KrishiDukaan?</h2><p>If you are a <strong>farmer</strong> — use KrishiDukan to find local suppliers, compare prices, and order online without traveling.</p><p>If you are an <strong>agri-retailer</strong> — use it to get a digital presence, attract new customers, and manage your inventory online.</p><p>If you are an <strong>agri-input manufacturer</strong> — use it to build your brand page, connect with retailers, and reach end farmers directly.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Visit <strong>krishidukan.com</strong>, allow location access, and instantly see agri stores and products near you.

    excerpt: "Online agri-input buying is growing fast in India — but so are fake products. Here's how to buy fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds online safely and get genuine products every time.",
    content: `<h2>Online Agri-Shopping Is Growing Fast — But So Are the Risks</h2><p>India's agricultural input market is worth over ₹2 lakh crore annually. As digital penetration grows in rural areas, more farmers are trying to buy fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides online. The convenience is real — but so are the risks of counterfeit products and unreliable suppliers.</p><h2>Why Counterfeit Agri-Inputs Are a Serious Problem</h2><p>The All India Crop Protection Association estimates that <strong>30–40% of pesticides sold in India may be substandard or fake</strong>. Counterfeit fertilizers deliver no nutrition to the soil; fake pesticides harm crops or fail to control pests.</p><p>Signs your agri-input may be counterfeit:</p><ul><li>Price is significantly lower than the MRP on the package</li><li>No valid batch number or manufacturing date</li><li>Label is blurry, spelling errors, or missing regulatory information</li><li>Seller is unregistered or has no physical address</li><li>Product has no company helpline number</li></ul><h2>5 Rules for Safe Online Agri-Input Buying</h2><h3>1. Only Buy from Verified, Registered Sellers</h3><p>In India, fertilizer dealers require a licence under the <strong>Fertilizer Control Order (FCO)</strong>. Pesticide dealers require a licence under the <strong>Insecticides Act</strong>. On KrishiDukaan, all listed retailers are registered and verified before they can list products.</p><h3>2. Check for a Physical Address and Phone Number</h3><p>Any legitimate agri-input seller has a physical shop. If a seller only has an email or WhatsApp number, that's a red flag.</p><h3>3. Compare Prices — But Be Suspicious of Deep Discounts</h3><p>Fertilizer prices are regulated by the government. A product sold at 40–50% below MRP is almost certainly adulterated or fake. A 5–15% discount from a licensed retailer is normal.</p><h3>4. Always Read the Product Label</h3><p>Every legitimate agri-input must carry: manufacturer name and address, registration/licence number, batch number, manufacturing and expiry date, chemical composition, and first aid instructions. If any of these are missing on delivery, reject the product.</p><h3>5. Keep Your Invoice</h3><p>A registered seller will always provide a bill. This is your proof of purchase if you need to complain to the state agriculture department about a substandard product.</p><h2>How KrishiDukan Makes This Easier</h2><p>On KrishiDukaan, every seller is verified, has a physical address on record, and can be reached by phone directly from the product listing. You can see real-time stock levels and order directly from the retailer with online delivery — with end-to-end order tracking.</p><blockquote>The safest online agri-purchase is one made from a local, registered retailer whose shop you can actually visit. KrishiDukan brings you exactly that — the convenience of online with the trust of local.</blockquote><h2>What to Do If You Receive a Fake Product</h2><ol><li>Don't use the product. Keep it sealed for evidence.</li><li>Report to the retailer immediately and ask for a replacement or refund.</li><li>If unresolved, report to your state's Agriculture Department or the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).</li><li>You can also file a complaint with the company whose product was faked — most major brands have dedicated helplines.</li></ol>`,

    content: `<h2>What Is a Biostimulant — and Why Do Farmers Need One?</h2><p>A biostimulant is a substance that, when applied to plants, stimulates natural processes to improve nutrient uptake, stress tolerance, and overall crop quality — without being a fertilizer or pesticide. Think of it as a "performance enhancer" for your crop.</p><h2>What Is Power Plus?</h2><p>Power Plus is a <strong>liquid seaweed extract biostimulant</strong> manufactured by KaranArjun. It is derived from <em>Ascophyllum nodosum</em> and other marine algae, cold-processed to preserve bioactive compounds.</p><p>Key active components:</p><ul><li><strong>Cytokinins</strong> — promote cell division, delay leaf senescence, improve fruit set</li><li><strong>Auxins</strong> — stimulate root initiation and elongation</li><li><strong>Gibberellins</strong> — improve germination, elongation, and flowering</li><li><strong>Betaines and mannitol</strong> — protect plants against drought and salinity stress</li><li><strong>Alginic acid</strong> — improves soil structure and microbial activity</li></ul><h2>What Results Do Farmers Report?</h2><ul><li><strong>Improved root development</strong> — visible within 7–10 days of application</li><li><strong>Better fruit colour and weight</strong> — particularly in grapes, pomegranate, tomato, and mango</li><li><strong>Improved fruit retention</strong> — reduced flower and fruit drop</li><li><strong>Stress recovery</strong> — faster recovery after drought, waterlogging, or cold spell</li><li><strong>Enhanced fertilizer efficiency</strong> — crops need 10–15% less NPK when biostimulants are applied</li></ul><blockquote>75,800+ farmers have used Power Plus across India. We don't just sell it — we recommend it because it consistently delivers results across diverse crops and soil types.</blockquote><h2>Which Crops Benefit Most?</h2><ul><li>Grapes (berry sizing and colour development)</li><li>Pomegranate (fruit retention and splitting reduction)</li><li>Tomato, Chilli, Capsicum (flower set and fruit sizing)</li><li>Paddy and Wheat (tillering and grain filling)</li><li>Sugarcane (stalk elongation and juice quality)</li><li>Cotton (boll development and retention)</li></ul><h2>How to Use Power Plus</h2><p><strong>Foliar spray:</strong> Mix 2–3 ml per litre of water. Spray at transplanting/establishment, vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit development stages.</p><p><strong>Drip/fertigation:</strong> Mix 1–1.5 litres per acre in irrigation water during active growth periods.</p><p><strong>Seed treatment:</strong> Soak seeds in 5 ml/litre solution for 6–8 hours before sowing to improve germination rate.</p><p>2–3 applications per crop cycle spaced 15–20 days apart give the best results.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><p>Power Plus is available from <strong>verified agri-retailers on KrishiDukaan</strong>. Search for "Power Plus" on the platform to see which nearby stores have it in stock and order online for home delivery.</p>`,
