/**
 * Re-runs the reel optimizer over reels that predate it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * transcodeReel is a Storage trigger: it fires when a reel is uploaded and has
 * never touched anything uploaded before it shipped. Those reels are still the
 * raw originals — 75–150MB 1080p clips with the moov atom at the end of the
 * file — and most of them have no poster frame. Google Search Console reports
 * them as "Video not processed" and "No thumbnail URL provided", and they are
 * also the slowest videos in the feed for real users.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS: A NUDGE, NOT A SECOND ENCODER
 * -------------------------------------------
 * This function does NOT re-implement the encode. Copying a Storage object onto
 * itself writes a new generation, which emits the same OBJECT_FINALIZE event an
 * upload does, so transcodeReel picks it up and does the work exactly as it
 * would for a fresh upload. A second copy of that ffmpeg pipeline would be a
 * second thing to keep in step with the first, and the two would drift.
 *
 * HOW AN UNPROCESSED REEL IS IDENTIFIED
 * -------------------------------------
 * transcodeReel deletes the source once it has written video_optimized.mp4, so
 * the mere existence of reels/{id}/video.mp4 means that reel was never
 * processed. No marker field, no migration flag, and nothing to keep in sync:
 * the storage layout already answers the question.
 *
 * SAFETY
 * ------
 * - Admin only, and dryRun is the DEFAULT. Call it once to see the list, then
 *   again with dryRun:false to act on it.
 * - Hard batch ceiling. Every nudge starts a 2 CPU / 2GiB encode that can run
 *   for minutes, and Cloud Functions will happily scale out to run hundreds at
 *   once — which is a large bill arriving as a surprise. Small batches, run
 *   repeatedly, keep the cost observable.
 * - Idempotent. A reel whose optimized file already exists is skipped, so a
 *   repeated run cannot re-encode what is already done.
