/**
 * Releases a seller's Razorpay Route transfer once their order is delivered.
 *
 * THE RULE
 * --------
 * Transfers are created on hold at checkout (see api/payment/create-cart-order).
 * Money sits with KrishiDukan until the seller marks the order delivered, and
 * then settles to them the NEXT DAY.
 *
 * WHY A FIRESTORE TRIGGER RATHER THAN AN API CALL
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * An order can be marked delivered from at least four places — the web seller
 * dashboard (app/firebase.ts updateOrderStatus), the mobile seller screen
 * (dashboard_repository.dart updateOrderStatus), the admin orders table, and the
 * WhatsApp webhook. Hanging the release off each of those means one of them
 * eventually ships without it, and the failure mode is a seller who delivered
 * and never got paid. A trigger on the document catches every path, including
 * ones added later.
 *
 * WHY NO SCHEDULER
 * ----------------
 * The "next day" delay is Razorpay's `on_hold_until`, not a cron of ours. We set
 * a release timestamp once, at delivery, and Razorpay settles at that moment. A
 * scheduled job re-checking held transfers would be a second source of truth
 * that can drift, double-release, or silently stop running.
 *
 * REVERSALS ARE OUT OF SCOPE by decision — this only ever releases.
